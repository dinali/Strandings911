# Strandings911

this is the list of changes made by Dina Li and suggested follow-up tasks

for all of these, check that the list of locations is correct, I added the new locations AFTER the current locations

ARAMessageViewController -- added new locations

ARAGPS -- added new locations here: withinServiceArea(), inStateWatersAt()

isLocationOffshore(), TODO: do additional polygons need to be added here??

ARAQuestionViewController -- added new locations

Category.h and Category.m -- there seemed to be a problem with using the word "Category" - it's a reserved word, so I renamed the files NOAACategory.

ARAMammalPreload.m  -- create new species
